# Presets
This is a repository for MZmine batch processing files and MZwizard preset files. Feel free to add files that may be helpful to others to reproduce your **paper** or to set up MZmine processing with the MZwizard.

In the future, we will integrate this repository into MZmine and make files searchable and reusable.

## MZwizard presets 
MZwizard presets define MZmine workflows partially or fully. This way, users may define presets for their chromatography method and name it something like this: RP-LC-10min. Similar things are possible for specific mass spectrometers and acquisition methods.


## MZmine batch files
Batch files define each processing step and all their parameters. This allows reproducible analysis in MZmine. Each publication with data processed in MZmine should be accompanied by at least one batch file. 


## Uploading new files
1. Create a **user folder** like 'robinschmid' in the [batch_files](https://github.com/mzmine/mzwizard_presets/tree/main/batch_files) and/or [wizard_presets](https://github.com/mzmine/mzwizard_presets/tree/main/wizard_presets) directories.
